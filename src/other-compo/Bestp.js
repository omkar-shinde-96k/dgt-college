    In the first term of every academic year, lectures on research methodology
    are conducted separately for the students of each faculty. Through these
    lectures, we make the students familiar with the process of research.
    Furthermore, our faculty members continuously motivate and guide the
    students to select and carry out the projects. We also encourage them to
    present their projects in district-level inter-collegiate research project
    presentation competition, Avishkar Research Convention, organized by the
    university. Staff published their research papers in reputed journals and
    presume themselves in this culture which college has established.&nbsp;

    Due to research friendly culture in the college, number of students taking
    part in district-level intercollegiate research project presentation
    competition has been increasing every year. Moreover, the number of projects
    selected for university-level inter-collegiate research project presentation
    competition has also been increasing. Along with students we have

    Initially, the students did not come forward for research related activity
    as it was tedious and mind focusing. Our faculty members consistently worked
    to persuade, encourage, select and guide the students in carrying out

    sciences is required. &nbsp;

    students a quality-oriented personality in society. Teaching staff members
    have taken an initiative along with the guidance of IQAC Coordinator and
